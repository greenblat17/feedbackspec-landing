## Problem Description - See Yourself Here

You're a successful indie hacker with $5k-50k MRR. Your users actively give feedback through Twitter, Discord, email, Reddit, Product Hunt, Intercom, and app reviews. Every day you receive valuable ideas for new features and improvements.

**But here's the problem:** You spend 3-5 hours every week manually checking all these platforms, copy-pasting feedback into Notion or Trello, categorizing it, and prioritizing requests. Then another hour goes into writing specifications for Cursor or Claude Code.

That's **15 hours per month** of your precious developer time! Time you could spend coding, marketing, or growing your product. You feel like you're losing momentum and can't keep up with the flow of user ideas.

You know you're missing important insights because you physically can't track every channel. And when you finally find time to organize feedback, you spend half the evening creating specifications for AI coding assistants instead of actual coding.

## Problem - Developer Pain

**Scattered feedback is killing your productivity**

Every day you juggle between 5-7 different feedback sources. Twitter mentions, Discord messages, email support, Reddit comments, Product Hunt reviews - everything is scattered across the internet.

You know you're missing important insights because you physically can't monitor every channel. And when you find time to organize feedback, you spend half your evening creating specifications for AI coding assistants instead of real coding.

**The result:** Slower development, stress from chaos, and missed opportunities for product growth.

## Testimonials - Our Success Stories

### Alex, founder of TaskFlow (MRR: $12k)
