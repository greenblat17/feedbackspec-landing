# Go-to-Market Manifesto: FeedbackSpec

## 1. ICP

We focus on indie hackers and solo founders with established MRR ($5k-50k/month) who use AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude Code, or GitHub Copilot for rapid development ("vibe coding"). These are bootstrapped or early-stage funded founders who have paying customers and receive regular feedback but struggle with organization.

Secondary ICP includes small startup teams (2-10 people) with technical CEO/CTOs who also rely on AI coding tools for feature development. Both segments operate lean, value developer productivity highly, and prefer lightweight tools over enterprise solutions. They typically run B2B SaaS or consumer subscription apps and have moved beyond the hobbyist stage to generating meaningful revenue.

## 2. Current Workflow / Jobs to be Done and Pain Points

These founders currently collect feedback from 5+ scattered sources: Twitter mentions, Discord communities, email support, Reddit discussions, Product Hunt comments, Intercom conversations, and app store reviews. They manually check each platform, copy-paste feedback into tools like Trello, Notion, or Google Sheets, then spend hours categorizing and prioritizing requests. Finally, they write development specs and input them into AI coding assistants to implement features.

This process consumes 3-5 hours weekly of valuable developer time that could be spent coding. Teams resort to complex Zapier workflows and describe the manual organization as "challenging" and "a PITA workflow wise." The biggest pain is the disconnect between feedback collection and development workflow.

**My company FeedbackSpec helps indie hackers and small startup teams using AI coding assistants by helping them automatically convert scattered customer feedback into ready-to-use development specs for Cursor and Claude Code.**

## 3. Price

Indie hackers typically value their time at $75-150/hour based on their MRR and opportunity cost. The current manual feedback management process takes approximately 15 hours per month. At $100/hour average rate, this represents $1,500 in monthly opportunity cost. Following the 10x value rule, our optimal pricing is $99/month for the Pro plan targeting successful indie hackers and small teams.

We'll offer a Starter plan at $49/month for solo founders just scaling up, making it accessible while capturing significant value. This pricing aligns with typical SaaS productivity tools in this market and represents a clear ROI when founders can redirect 15 hours monthly back to product development and revenue-generating activities.

## 4. The Solution

FeedbackSpec is a simple SaaS platform with one-click integrations to popular feedback sources (Twitter, Discord, email, Reddit, Intercom, app reviews). Upon signup with email authentication, users connect their feedback channels through a clean dashboard. Our AI engine automatically categorizes feedback by type (bug, feature request, improvement), prioritizes by user impact and MRR contribution, and generates development specs optimized specifically for AI coding assistants.

Key features include automated feedback collection from 10+ sources, AI-powered categorization and priority scoring, one-click spec generation in Cursor/Claude Code format, direct export to AI coding tools, and a simple dashboard showing feedback trends and implementation status. The product focuses solely on the feedback-to-spec workflow rather than trying to be a full project management solution.

## 5. Go to Market Motion (Sales & Marketing)

**Marketing Channels:** Primary focus on Indie Hackers community where this exact problem is actively discussed, Twitter/X for reaching building-in-public founders, targeted Reddit engagement in r/SaaS and r/IndieHackers, and Product Hunt for launch visibility. Content marketing through blog posts about AI coding workflows and feedback management, plus YouTube tutorials demonstrating the feedback-to-development pipeline will drive organic discovery.

**Purchasing Habits:** This ICP prefers self-serve credit card subscriptions with monthly/annual billing options. They expect 14-day free trials, transparent pricing, and immediate value demonstration. No complex enterprise sales needed - simple onboarding with quick setup and instant feedback import. Price-conscious but willing to pay for clear productivity gains, especially tools that integrate with their existing AI coding workflow.
