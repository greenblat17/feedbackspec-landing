## Problem Section (ProblemSectionEnhanced)

**Title:** The Indie Hacker's Double Nightmare

**Subtitle:** You have two problems killing your growth: scattered feedback chaos AND slow feature development.

*Indie hackers lose $47k annually to feedback chaos and slow development*

### Problem #1: Feedback Hell

- **No prioritization**: Building features nobody wants
- **Time vampire**: 15+ hours weekly just organizing

### Problem #2: Slow Development

- **Generic prompts**: AI tools need perfect input
- **Context switching**: From feedback to code requirements
- **Missed opportunities**: Competitors shipping faster

### The Killer Insight
These problems are connected. Bad feedback organization = bad development priorities = wasted AI coding potential.

### The Cost of Feedback Chaos
