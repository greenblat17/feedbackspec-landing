## Problem Section (ProblemSectionEnhanced)

**Title:** The Founder's Double Nightmare

**Subtitle:** You have two problems killing your growth: scattered feedback chaos AND slow feature development.

**Live Counter:** Opportunities missed: [Live Counter] while you're organizing feedback

### Problem #1: Feedback Hell
- **20+ sources**: Twitter, email, Discord, GitHub, Slack...
- **Zero organization**: Lost in threads and notifications
- **No prioritization**: Building features nobody wants
- **Time vampire**: 15+ hours weekly just organizing

**Visualization:** Feedback Graveyard showing expired feedback messages from different platforms

### Problem #2: Slow Development  
- **Manual specs**: 3+ hours writing specifications
- **Generic prompts**: AI tools need perfect input
- **Context switching**: From feedback to code requirements
- **Missed opportunities**: Competitors shipping faster

**Visualization:** Developer flow visualization showing time wasted (80% writing specs manually)

### The Killer Insight
These problems are connected. Bad feedback organization = bad development priorities = wasted AI coding potential.
