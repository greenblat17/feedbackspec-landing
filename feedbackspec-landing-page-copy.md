## Problem Section

### Main Title
The Founders's Development Hell

### Subtitle
You started building because you love creating solutions. But now you're stuck in an endless cycle of **feedback chaos** that's **killing your momentum**.

### Opportunities Counter
127 valuable features ignored
while you're organizing feedback

### Problem #1: Feedback Chaos
- **Platform Scattered Hell**: 20+ sources: Twitter, Discord, emails
- **Zero Organization**: No tagging, no search, no history
- **Time Vampire**: 15+ hours weekly just organizing
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Too much noise, no clear signal
- **Lost Revenue**: Missing high-value feature requests

### Problem #2: Slow Development Cycle
- **Manual Specification Writing**: Hours turning feedback into specs
- **Generic AI Prompts**: Missing critical context & details
- **Context Switching Hell**: From feedback to code to debug
- **Reinventing the Wheel**: No spec templates or patterns
- **Competitor Advantage**: They ship while you plan

### Problem #3: Building the Wrong Things
- **Loudest Voice Bias**: Building for complainers, not payers
- **No Revenue Connection**: Can't link features to revenue
- **User Disappointment**: Features nobody actually uses
- **Churn Spiral**: Losing customers to competitors
- **Founder Burnout**: Working hard on wrong things

### The Real Cost of Feedback Chaos
- **73%** Features never used
- **3x** Slower than competitors
- **$47k** Lost annually

Every day you wait, competitors ship features your users asked for first.

### What if you could...
- Know exactly which features will **drive revenue**?
- Turn feedback into **AI-ready specs** in minutes?
- Ship **3x faster** than your competitors?

**CURSOR-READY PROMPT:**
"Build a complete search system for our product catalog. Create a React component with real-time search that updates as users type (debounce 300ms). Implement fuzzy matching to handle typos - if user types 'iphon' show 'iPhone'. Backend: Set up Elasticsearch with these mappings: product name (boost 3x), description, tags (boost 2x). Add Redis caching for the 100 most common searches. Frontend: Show autocomplete dropdown with product images, names, and prices. Include keyboard navigation (arrow keys + enter). Show loading spinner during search. Display 'No results found' with suggestions when empty. Track all searches in analytics. Performance requirement: Results must load in under 200ms. Use our existing API at /api/search. Style with Tailwind matching our design system. Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages."
